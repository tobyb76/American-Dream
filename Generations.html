				<h1>Wisdom Of Hiring Across The Six Living Generations In America And The World</h1>
				<p>In America, there are six living generations, which are six fairly distinct groups of people. As a generalization each generation has different likes, dislikes, and attributes. They have had collective experiences as they aged and therefore have similar ideals. A person's birth date may not always be indicative of their generational characteristics, but as a common group they have similarities.</p>
				<p>In these days of Big Data and Business Intelligence, we would never consider discarding or flushing a segment of data down the ethernet toilet. In fact, those of us who understand the value of Big Data and Business Intelligence, literally cherish it like bricks of gold. In these days of Big Data and Business Intelligence, I think we often forget the amazing "experiential data" that lives in the minds of our cross-generational workforce of knowledge workers. Before being resistant to hire someone that is "too young" or "too old" it would be wise to respect the depth and breadth of the experiential knowledge they bring to the table. I've never met a genius, but I have had 8-10 people in a boardroom who came from different generations, cultures, religious preferences and genders, with a wide variety of education and experience who were.
